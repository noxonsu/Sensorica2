## Installation
- Upload plugin to WordpREss -> Admin -> Plugins 
- Enter your envato key in settings

## Just enter the instruction in plain text

- Use our examples or come up with your own

- The more text, the more complex and interesting the bot

- We also recommend familiarizing yourself with examples from awesome prompts or our database of leaked GPTs

## Enter OpenAI API key 

- All requests are sent to GPT-3.5-turbo by default

- We recommend a separate key for each bot (to track activity)

- Or specify the default in the plugin settings

## Think of a chat title 
- It's the first thing users see

- Or use the magic button and AI will come up with a title itself

- In the title ask the user to say something to the bot
